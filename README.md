## WhoLockedMe

#### Credits
 * Credits to HotkeyIt for the super complicated handle retrievement!
 * Credits to jNizM for the neat QueryDosDevice function!
 * Credits to Lexokos and "just me" for the GetIconGroupNameByIndex fucntion!

#### Requirements
The script requires [AHK_H](https://github.com/HotKeyIt/ahkdll-v2-release/archive/master.zip), I will, however, try my best to port it to AHK_L.  
If you just want to test it you can download the compiled version. (See link below)

#### Future ideas include:
- only show handles that are definitely locking a file
- option to force a process to release a certain handle
- another tab that shows which process is responsible for blocking which port
- option to force a process to stop listenting on a certain port
- abstract the code and put it into useful functions or classes so that it can be easily used by other scripts
