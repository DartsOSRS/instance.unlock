#### Requirements
The script requires AHK 1.1. An older version that works for AHK_H can be found in the subfolder /AHK_H.
If you just want to test it you can download the compiled version. (See link below)

#### Future ideas include:
- only show handles that are definitely locking a file
- option to force a process to release a certain handle
- option to close all handles responsible for keeping a device from ejecting
- another tab that shows which process is responsible for blocking which port
- option to force a process to stop listenting on a certain port
