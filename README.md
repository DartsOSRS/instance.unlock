#### Requirements
The script requires AHK_L. An older version that works for AHK_H can be found in the subfolder /AHK_H.
If you just want to test it you can download the compiled version. (See link below)

#### Future ideas include:
- only show handles that are definitely locking a file
- option to force a process to release a certain handle
- another tab that shows which process is responsible for blocking which port
- option to force a process to stop listenting on a certain port
- abstract the code and put it into useful functions or classes so that it can be easily used by other scripts
